https://community.ubnt.com/t5/EdgeMAX/IPTV-IGMP-Multicast-Solution-for-Edgemax-Router/td-p/1253350

It's been a long time since I got back to this issue with the Edge max router 
and my IPTV service provider. Anyway,  just wanted to share my solution to the 
IPTV/IGMP/Multicast issue. Anyway, my router is an ER8 currently on v1.6.0. 
I was searching for a solution and went thru many posts, but all would basically 
said you need to just have this basic IGMP-Proxy 
(in this case my eth1 is the Internet & eth2 is the LAN)

FH note (my router has Internet on eth0 an LAN1 on eth1)
 
    igmp-proxy {
        interface eth1 {
            alt-subnet 0.0.0.0/0
            role upstream
            threshold 1
        }
        interface eth2 {
            alt-subnet 0.0.0.0/0
            role downstream
            threshold 1
 
But with that configuration, I still had freezing video issue within 15 to 30 sec.  Luckily I found an another thread that talked about adding source and destination in the firewall. See thread by user synackack Edgerouter Lite v1.6.0 multicast IPTV / simple setup
 
Anyway,  Here is my setup. eth1 is my Internet and eth2 is my LAN (192.168.1.1/24).
 
First setup the IGMP Proxy
 
ubnt@ubnt# show protocols
 igmp-proxy {
     interface eth1 {
         alt-subnet 0.0.0.0/0
         role upstream
         threshold 1
     }
     interface eth2 {
         alt-subnet 0.0.0.0/0
         role downstream
         threshold 1
     }
 }
 
 
Then save the config. after that show
 
ubnt@ubnt:~$ show ip multicast mfc
Group           Origin           In     Out           Pkts         Bytes  Wrong
239.255.255.250 192.168.1.3      eth1   eth2           179       75.59KB    179
239.255.255.250 192.168.1.3      eth1   eth3           179       75.59KB    179
239.11.5.79     10.33.1.38       eth1   eth2        106949      139.80MB      0
 
In my case, 192.168.1.3 is my STB (set top box).  239.11.5.79 is the TV channel IP coming from the provider's IP of 10.33.1.38.   So now I know what my source and destination IP range addresses the service provider is using. I need to add the IPs into my firewall.  So in the GUI of the edge router, you need to be under firewall policy tab. For simulation purpose I setup my router using the GUI setup wizard. So by default the router created 2 firewall policies WAN_IN & WAN_LOCAL.  So I added 2 more rulesets for each firewall policy (WAN_IN & WAN_LOCAL).  I added "Allow IPTV Multicast UDP" & "Allow IGMP" and put them in the first and second order of the policy. It's important to have them in the first and second order. If you have other ruleset before these 2, then you may have an issue. See picture
 
Firewall Policy to add Multicast IP
 
So in the CLI commad, my firewall policy would look like this:
 
ubnt@ubnt# show firewall
 all-ping enable
 broadcast-ping disable
 ipv6-receive-redirects disable
 ipv6-src-route disable
 ip-src-route disable
 log-martians disable

     }
 }

     rule 1 {

         }
     }
     rule 2 {

         }
     }
 }

     rule 1 {

         source {

             group {
             }
         }
     }
     rule 2 {
         action accept
         description "Allow IGMP"
         log disable
         protocol igmp
     }
     rule 3 {
         action accept
         state {
             established enable
             related enable
         }
     }
     rule 4 {
         action drop
         state {
             invalid enable
         }
     }
 }
 receive-redirects disable
 send-redirects enable
 source-validation disable
 syn-cookies enable
 
 
 
And that is it for me. So for other newbies like me who's searching on this type of issue, they can find this thread easily and can start with this basic help.  Thanks all for contributing your technical support.  Thanks synackack for giving me a hint.
